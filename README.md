# Vs Automatic Temp File Cleaner

This is a free extension for Visual Studio 2019.

It automatically cleans temporary files generated by Visual Studio when closing the IDE.

# **Description**

Are you fed up with the size of your temp directory growing up by several gigabytes and the number of files inside multiplying by hundreds because of Visual Studio's lack of deleting its own temp files?.

Then this extension is for you.

This extension removes loads of temporary files from disk that are generated by Visual studio at: 'C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Local\Temp\' and other directories.

Don't worry, this extension is very safe to be used, it will not and cannot remove important files by accident.

Notice that after closing Visual Studio, a log file will be generated at 'C:\Users\{USERNAME}\AppData\Local\Temp\VsAutomaticTempFileCleaner.log' containing the names of the temp files that had been removed.
