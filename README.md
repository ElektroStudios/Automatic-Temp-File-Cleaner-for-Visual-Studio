------------------

## üëã Introduction

Do you knew that if you do use Visual Studio with frequently, and not do a system cleaning frequently, the size of your system's temp directory at the end will grow up by several gigabytes and the number of files inside will be multiplied by hundreds because of Visual Studio's lack of deleting its own temp files?.

Here is the final solution for that.

After you install this extension, every time that you close Visual Studio this extension will keep your system clean by removing temporary files from disk that are generated by Visual studio in 'C:\Users\\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Temp\' and other locations.

Don't worry, this extension is very safe to be used, it will not and cannot remove important files accidentally. In fact it will keep / ignore any temp file that is not related with Visual Studio.

Please be aware that after closing Visual Studio, a log file will be generated in 'C:\Users\\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Temp\VsAutomaticTempFileCleaner.log' containing the records for the temp files that had been removed.

This extension care to delete temp files related to Background Download, Diagnostic Tools, NuGet, VS settings log files, VS telemetry and VSIX package extraction between other kind of VS temp files, including those disgusting files and directories in your system's temp folder having random alphanumeric naming pattern like: ########.###

I hope this finally helps people to say goodbye to the thousands of Visual Studio files that remain in the temporary folder pending for clean.
